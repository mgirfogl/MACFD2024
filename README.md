# Models and Applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Michele Girfoglio (<mgirfogl@sissa.it>)

## Program

The course provides an introduction to the numerical simulation of laminar and turbulent incompressible flows by using a finite volume method. Each topic will be corroborated by a set of numerical examples to be performed within the open source C++ finite volume library OpenFOAM.

## Location

All lectures will be delivered at SISSA.
